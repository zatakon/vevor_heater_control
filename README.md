# vevor heater control
Vevor diesel heater control project

## why?
There is project for communication with chinnese heaters, but this broadly used protocol in cheap diesel heaters is unfortunately not used in Vevor ones. By date I needed to control the one I have in storage there was no serious work in this topic, so I started investigation by my own. 

## goal
Make component for ESPHome for full control of Vevor diesel heaters.

## current status of the project
There are two projects - one for reading data frames from Vevor heater, second project connected to Home assistant sending current status. 
Turning the heater on and off remotely will come soon.

## few things to know
The conroller sends every second command to main unit. Unit sends back current status.
Baudrate is 4.8 kbaud. 

## hardware
The bus is open drain. Basic voltage is cca 4V and very noisy (3.3 - 6V). Dont connect directly to any MCU without protection, there is risk that magic smoke will escape... 

## controller
Hardware seems to be very similar as described by [Ray Jones](https://gitlab.com/mrjones.id.au/bluetoothheater/-/blob/master/Documentation/V9%20-%20Hacking%20the%20Chinese%20Diesel%20Heater%20Communications%20Protocol.pdf?ref_type=heads)
Half duplex communication using NPN, PNP transistors and EN pin driving them. 
The CPU in Vevor controller is most likely 5V tolerant, unlike our ESP32. I created simple circuit for safe connection between Vevor bus and my Esp32.

##### connection to esp32
This is simple schematics how I connected my Esp32 to the bus.
